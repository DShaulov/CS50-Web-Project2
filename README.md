# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

a chatroom application, features include:

1.Display Name: When a user visits the web application for the first time, they should are prompted to type in a display name that will eventually be associated with every message they  send. If a user closes the page and returns to the app later, the display name will still be remembered.

2.Channel Creation: Any user will be able to create a new channel, so long as its name doesnâ€™t conflict with the name of an existing channel.

3.Channel List: Users will be able to see a list of all current channels, and selecting one will allow the user to view the channel.

4.Messages View: Once a channel is selected, the user will see any messages that have already been sent in that channel, up to a maximum of 100 messages. 

5.Sending Messages: Once in a channel, users will be able to send text messages to others the channel. When a user sends a message, their display name and the timestamp of the message will be associated with the message. All users in the channel will then see the new message (with display name and timestamp) appear on their channel page. Sending and receiving messages should will not require reloading the page.

Remembering the Channel: If a user is on a channel page, closes the web browser window, and goes back to the application, the application will remember what channel the user was on previously and take the user back to that channel.

6.Personal Touch: users entering a chatroom will be able to see who is in the chatroom with them.
